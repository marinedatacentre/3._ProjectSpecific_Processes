<td><p>Clean up entries with missing or incomprehensible bibliographic information. A search on Google Scholar for a given title will often identify accurate spelling. For government reports, it may necessary to go back into the Federal Sciences Library to investigate.</p>
<p>Things to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All caps are used for article and journal titles - convert these to title case.</p></li>
<li><p>dois are included as a "URL" as opposed to a "Catalog ID". When this is the case, remove the "http://dx.doi.org/" prefix and place the doi in the appropriate "Catalog ID" field, deleting the associated url. Leaving the full url will break the auto generation of doi links when interpreted by thescript that generates the html interface for the final BibTex file.</p></li>
<li><p>Dates are missing - locate dates. This often occurs with reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Unusual characters are noticed - replace with proper characters. This often occurs with poorly encoded accents or other special characters.</p></li>
<li><p>Journal abbreviations are used - replace with the full journal title.</p></li>
