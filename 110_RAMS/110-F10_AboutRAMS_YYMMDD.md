**About the Risk Assessment Method for Salmon:**

The Risk Assessment Method for Salmon (RAMS) was originally developed to provide a series of tools that could be used to comprehensively assess a broad selection of threats or limiting factors affecting Pacific salmon stocks. More specifically, stocks of conservation concern in BC and the Yukon due to low abundance, limited empirical data, and/or high uncertainty regarding the impacts of threats.

Initially, RAMS was designed to support the Wild Salmon Policy. Over time, it has been adapted to support Recovery Potential Assessments for stocks being considered for listing under the Canadian *Species at Risk Act*. More recently, it has also been adapted for supporting Rebuilding Plans for stocks prescribed to the Fish Stock Provisions of the *Fisheries Act* and efforts to support integrated assessment for Pacific salmon.

**What is RAMS?**

RAMS is a set of processes (e.g. limiting factor analysis, risk ranking) and tools (e.g. maps, ecosystem status report, simple life stage tables) applied in a series of steps. Application of RAMS is generally done in conjunction with an expert workshop(s) to:

- Assess science, local knowledge, and expert opinion on the state of a salmon population, Conservation Units (CUs), or Stock Management Units (SMUs) and their associated habitats.

- Identify natural and human-origin factors most likely to limit production of a group of salmon (i.e., populations, CUs, or SMUs).

- Identify options or actions to overcome the factors limiting salmon production.

- Create a retrievable record that enables verification of origin states and future changes to RAMS assessment results and recommendations

**Goals**

RAMS has been designed to provide a structured process to:

1.  Scope the scale of the recovery, restoration, or rebuilding assessment;

2.  Assemble relevant existing salmon population and ecosystem information;

3.  Systematically assess and prioritize a comprehensive list of factors limiting current and future productive capacity of salmon under climate change;

4.  Identify key knowledge gaps to direct scientific research and/or monitoring and describe potential mitigation options; and

5.  Monitor, review, and re-evaluate options for recovery and rebuilding under an adaptive management framework.

This methodology has been implemented for a variety of salmon populations, CUs, and SMUs in the Pacific Region since development. Each of them applied the RAMS protocols with adjustments to account for locally unique features of the population being assessed and variation in the available data and relevant analyses. Over time, the methods have been refined for consistent regional implementation. Also, through applying the RAMS framework and other risk assessment methodologies such as the ERAEF to real-world fisheries examples, practitioners have acquired best practices and lessons learned that can facilitate improved future implementation of the frameworks.
